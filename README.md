[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

This repository contains the implementation of ETHOS from the paper "Why Play the Lottery When You Can Just Win?"

ETHOS is a novel architecture that dynamically generates millions of tiny experts from compressed latent representations, achieving 8.7B parameter capacity while using ~20× fewer FLOPs.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethos.git
cd ethos

# Install dependencies (requires Python 3.10+, CUDA 11.8+)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### Training ETHOS

The simplest way to train ETHOS is:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
1. Download 1% of the C4 dataset (configurable)
2. Train for 3 epochs with default settings
3. Save checkpoints and training logs

To use a custom configuration:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```

### Model Architecture

ETHOS combines several key innovations:
- **Dynamic expert generation**: Instead of storing millions of expert parameters, we generate them from 128-dimensional latent codes
- **Product-key routing**: Efficient O(√N) routing to 262K experts per layer utilizing Query BatchNorm from PEER
- **Reordered execution**: Custom Triton kernel achieving 8× speedup

### Configuration

Key parameters in `configs/default.yaml`:
- `num_experts`: 262,144 (512²) experts per layer
- `d_latent`: 128-dimensional latent codes
- `top_k`: 16 experts selected per token
- `num_routing_heads`: 8 independent routing heads

### Monitoring Training

Training progress is automatically logged and visualized:
- Real-time plots of loss, perplexity, learning rate
- CSV and JSON logs saved to `training_logs/`
- Checkpoints saved to `checkpoints/`

### Requirements

- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA 11.8+
- Triton 2.1+
- Flash Attention 2.0+
- 80GB+ GPU memory recommended

## Paper Results

On 1% of C4 dataset:
- Perplexity: 34.85 after 4B tokens
- Training speed: 15K tokens/second on GH200
- Memory efficiency: 16× reduction vs PEER
